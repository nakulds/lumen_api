Laravel Lumen is a stunningly fast PHP micro-framework for building web applications with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Lumen attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as routing, database abstraction, queueing, and caching.

## Security Vulnerabilities

## Deployment Comments

First, make sure you have Docker installed and running:
docker -v   or     docker --version

We will be creating a docker-compose.yml file so you need to make sure you have docker-compose enabled/installed.
docker-compose -v    or      docker-compose --version

To building and running our Lumen project on Docker
docker-compose up --build
